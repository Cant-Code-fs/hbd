  <div class="poem" style="--i:1;">
    <p>
You talk like a storm wrapped in light
A little wild, a little right
And I, just standing in your view
Fall a bit more every time I do.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:2;">
    <p>
If wishes came true with this rhyme
I'd give you joy, one heartbeat at a time
No fancy gifts, just me and this
A love that stays, a soft birthday kiss (virtual obv).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:3;">
    <p>
You rant, you rage, you go too far,
And still, I love just who you are.
You turn a Monday into a scene
And somehow make it feel serene.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:4;">
    <p>
I've never felt this, never before,
Not with anyone I liked before.
You're not just someone passing through
You're the one I always knew.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:5;">
    <p>
All the gm reels you share (chai ka phla cup sand k hatho se, bro wtf??)
Like sunlight written with extra care.
You send it plain, but in your way,
You brighten up my every day.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:6;">
    <p>
A screenshot of our silly chat
Means more to me than all of that.
Because in those texts, between the lines,
I feel you laughing and that's divine.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:7;">
    <p>
Even if you never feel the same
Even if I'm just a name
I'll still be proud to say I knew,
A soul as rare and bright as you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:8;">
    <p>
If I had the right words to say,
I'd write them all for you today.
But even poetry feels too small 
To hold the love that says it all.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:9;">
    <p>
You don't need to love me back
Or meet me on the same track.
Just know I'm here, and always true,
In every version that is you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:10;">
    <p>
You're the glitch in my calm mind
The song I can't skip, can't rewind
I'm lost in your every small move
An addiction I don't wanna lose.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:11;">
    <p>
They say obsession is a heavy chain,
But I'd wear your name like rain.
A thousand lives, a thousand tries
I'd still find you in every sky.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:12;">
    <p>
I don't pray for quiet skies,
Or a life without a mess.
I just want your voice at night,
My kind of chaos, my kind of rest.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem" style="--i:13;">
    <p>
You ask me why I love you so,
As if love needs a map to show.
Even I don't know the rhyme or way 
But I'm sure as hell I'd choose you every day.
Not for a reason I can write or say,
Not for the laughs, the looks, or plays.
It's just you ‚Äî the mess, the light, the scars,
My heart chose you, without a why, among the stars.
    </p>
  </div>
